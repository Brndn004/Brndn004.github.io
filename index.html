<h1>Welcome to my terrible website</h1>

<p>
I don't know how this works. 
I'm so confused. 
Read about my box truck adventures and other random stuff I think about sometimes.

So I for sure don't know what I'm doing with this website, which is why it looks so darn good.
Anyway, I'll occasionally be posting about stuff I'm working on, so stay tuned.
Here's a picture of the box truck at its first doctor's appointment.
